Password Generator.
This is the week 3 homework assignment. it is a random password generator that contains your choice of length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It works by throwing all of the chosen data sets into one large array and randomly picking one character out of that array. It does this random choice the amount of times that you choose your password length to be and then it puts all the characters next to each other.
